# European Boating Licenses & ICC

There is no single EU-wide boating license. Each country sets its own requirements. Many European countries (Germany, Italy, Croatia, Greece, etc.) recognize the International Certificate of Competence (ICC), not U.S. state boating cards.

Thus, an NY/NJ Boating Safety Certificate is not automatically valid in Europe.

If you want a credential broadly recognized in Europe, you’ll likely need the ICC. In the U.S., the U.S. Powerboating Association and American Sailing Association (ASA) can issue ICCs to members who complete their training.

## What Is the ICC and Where Is It Required?

The ICC is an internationally recognized boating certificate, issued under the **United Nations Resolution 40** (UNECE), which serves as proof of competence for operating pleasure craft abroad ([Wikipedia][1]).

Many European countries—especially those in the Mediterranean (e.g., Greece, Croatia)—require or strongly prefer an ICC to charter or operate boats ([Wikipedia][1], [Noonsite][2]).

## How to Get an ICC

### 1. **Through IYT Worldwide (International Yacht Training Worldwide)**

* IYT is authorized by several governments—like the UK and Ireland—to issue ICCs, even to U.S. citizens, if they meet the eligibility requirements under Resolution 40 ([Wikipedia][1]).

* To obtain it:

  * Complete a qualifying IYT course (like Flotilla Skipper, Bareboat Skipper, or the Small Powerboat & RIB Master).
  * Or hold a recognized certification that meets ICC standards.
  * Then send documentation (photo ID, digital signature, course certificate) to IYT, pay the fee—and they’ll issue the ICC ([IYT Worldwide][3]).

### 2. **Through the Royal Yachting Association (RYA)**

* RYA issues ICCs, especially for non-UK citizens from countries not party to Resolution 40 (like the U.S.) ([NauticEd Sailing Blog][4], [Wikipedia][1]).
* There are two main pathways:

  1. **Assessment**: Attend a one-day on-water practical/theory assessment at a licensed RYA ICC center ([Sunsail][5], [NauticEd Sailing Blog][4]).
  2. **Course Completion**: Complete RYA-level courses such as **Day Skipper**, **Day Skipper Motor**, or **PB2 (Powerboat Level 2)**—these automatically qualify you to apply for the ICC with minimal additional testing ([Seven Seas Yachting][6], [NauticEd Sailing Blog][4]).

### 3. **Alternative—ASA's International Proficiency Certificate (IPC)**

* The **American Sailing Association (ASA)** offers the **International Proficiency Certificate (IPC)**, which is a U.S.-based approximation of the ICC—though it's not equivalent and not officially the same ([Noonsite][2], [rarerarebird.blogspot.com][7]).
* Some foreign charters may accept it, but it is not universally recognized like the ICC.

## Summary: Comparison of ICC Issuers

| **Provider**                           | **Eligibility**                                     | **Pathway to ICC**                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IYT Worldwide**                      | U.S. citizens can qualify (Resolution 40 non-issue) | Complete IYT-recognized course → Submit ID, digital signature, & course proof → Receive ICC |
| **Royal Yachting Association (RYA)**   | Non-Resolution 40 nationals (e.g. U.S.)             | Take Day Skipper / PB2 course or one-day assessment → Apply for ICC                         |
| **American Sailing Association (ASA)** | U.S. option, not officially ICC-compliant           | Receive IPC (may be accepted by some charters but not equivalent to ICC)                    |

## Sailing Reddit 

> *“...attend an RYA school and take the day skipper course… then apply for the ICC,”* and the ICC is valid for 5 years ([Reddit][8]).

> *“ICC is not a commercial ticket. It is strictly for leisure use…”* and even with an ICC, additional certificates (e.g., VHF, first aid, commercial endorsements) are necessary for commercial operations ([Reddit][8]).

## Next Steps

1. **Choose a pathway**:

   * **IYT route**: Great if you want a U.S.-accessible option backed by international recognition.
   * **RYA route**: Ideal if you prefer European-based accreditation and assessment.

2. **Contact your chosen organization**:

   * For **IYT**, find a partner school or submit your documents directly (photo ID, digital signature, qualifying course completion).
   * For **RYA**, locate a certified center offering Day Skipper or PB2 courses, or schedule the assessment.

3. **Gather paperwork**: Valid ID (passport), course certificate, shipping address, etc.
4. **Submit application** and pay applicable fees.
5. **Receive your ICC** (typically valid for 5 years).
