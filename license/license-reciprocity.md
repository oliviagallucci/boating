# NY NASBLA-License Reciprocity

Based on the [reciprocity table](https://www.uscgboating.org/regulations/state-boating-laws-details.php?id=13&title), the **New Jersey NASBLA-approved boating license is not valid or not required** in the following jurisdictions:

---

## **States/Territories That Do *Not* Accept NASBLA Reciprocity**

* **Michigan** – Does not honor NASBLA reciprocity at all.
* **Mississippi** – Only accepts *state-issued* certificates; does **not** honor NASBLA reciprocity.
* **Puerto Rico** – Does not accept or honor out-of-state or NASBLA boating education certificates.
* **Northern Mariana Islands** – States "No" to accepting out-of-state education certificates, but oddly "Yes" to NASBLA reciprocity (contradiction; safest to assume **not viable**).

---

## **States/Territories Where No Education Requirement Exists (License Not Needed, So Yours Has No Effect)**

* **Alaska** – No mandatory education requirements.
* **California** – No education required to operate a vessel (though all CA courses are NASBLA-approved).
* **South Dakota** – No boating education requirements.
* **Wyoming** – Lists as "n/a," effectively no requirement.

---

## **Special / Limited Acceptance**

* **Connecticut** – Accepts only *NASBLA courses taught by an instructor in a classroom* (online NJ courses may not count).
* **New Hampshire** – Requires that the certificate be *issued by another state agency* (not just NASBLA directly).
* **Wisconsin** – Only valid if your NASBLA course is also *recognized by your state of residence* (NJ qualifies, so you should be okay).
* **Utah** – Reciprocity applies specifically under their *PWC program*.

## Accepted States

Nearly all other U.S. states (Alabama, Florida, Texas, Virginia, etc.) *do* honor NASBLA-approved courses, so an NJ license is valid in those.
